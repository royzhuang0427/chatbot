前言
無論你的英文起步是從哪裡開始，請相信「累積」這件事情。
我自己不喜歡背單字書，但，我很喜歡記「我自己挑出來的單字」。這就像，去自助餐選自己喜歡的菜才好吃。
Chris 從認真學英文，到現在抄了至少十本單字佳句，至少累積了一萬多個，而至今還在累積當中，記下來的
目的是，讓我自己學習能有個記錄指標，才不會船過水無痕。
為什麼我還要編輯這本單字講義呢，因為多益考題來的，我要讓大家知道，做了考題，檢討之後，會有些新單
字，就需要把它記下來，因此，這本單字 PDF 只是拋磚引玉，希望同學不要只背這本書裡面的單字，一定也
要找本筆記本，好好記錄字成長的軌跡。至於記單字，怎麼樣才算記熟呢? 你可以簡單問自己：能不能「聽到
它能在0.1秒反應意思」? 你可以參考以下的四個步驟來內化：
內化步驟
Rule 黃金四步驟
記聲音 輸入字典，一直播放字典聲音 (嘴巴跟著唸出來)，或輸入到Youglish，連續聽。
找例句 在字典閱讀三個「有感例句」，找高頻搭配的字串。
刻意用 刻意練習使用在自己的生活裡。
看閱讀 把字串輸入在Google中，找三個段落閱讀單字、片語、句型在文本裡面如何呈現。
記住聲音是最重要的，聲音才是記單字的源頭，大家一定要把聲音聽熟喔，聲音記熟了，能對意思產生立即反
應，就要練習用情境去學習例句，你可以看字典，刻意使用他，甚至去找短篇文章閱讀，都做過上述步驟，就
能跟這個單字很熟了，一回生，二回熟，就不怕忘記，大家加油！
Chris 的單字本例句本

我們下次見 😊😊

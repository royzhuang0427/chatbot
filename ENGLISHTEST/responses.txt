I'd be happy to help you with a different request. Since you didn't specify what you need help with, I'll provide a general response.

**Let's review pronouns and practice with explanations!**

Pronouns are an essential part of the English language, and mastering them can help you improve your TOEIC scores. Let's review some key points:

* **Subject pronouns**: I, you, he, she, it, we, they (e.g., "I am writing a report.")
* **Object pronouns**: me, you, him, her, it, us, them (e.g., "My manager gave me a task.")
* **Possessive pronouns**: my, your, his, her, its, our, their (e.g., "This is my book.")
* **Reflexive pronouns**: myself, yourself, himself, herself, itself, ourselves, themselves (e.g., "I cut myself while cooking.")
* **Demonstrative pronouns**: this, that, these, those (e.g., "Can you pass me that book?")
* **Interrogative pronouns**: who, what, which, whom, whose (e.g., "Who is going to the meeting?")
* **Indefinite pronouns**: someone, something, anyone, anything, etc. (e.g., "Someone left their umbrella in the office.")

Now, let's practice with some explanations:

1. In question 1, the correct answer is (B) their, because "their" is a possessive pronoun showing that the duties belong to the workers.
2. In question 2, the correct answer is (B) every, because "every" is an indefinite pronoun indicating that each vehicle has a GPS device.
3. In question 3, the correct answer is (A) whose, because "whose" is a possessive pronoun describing the speakers who have established successful businesses.
4. In question 4, the correct answer is (C) which, because "which" is a relative pronoun describing the product model that Ms. Okoro decided to purchase.

**Study tips and suggestions:**

* Review the different types of pronouns and their uses.
* Practice identifying the correct pronoun in context.
* Read and listen to English materials to improve your understanding of pronouns in use.
* Make flashcards to help you remember the correct pronouns for different situations.

It seems like you want me to help you with running a Python script to automate checking answers for the TOEIC-style questions. 

Here's a possible implementation of the Python script:

```
python

    9: 'C',
    10: 'B',
    11: 'B',
    12: '?'  # Assuming the question is incomplete
}

questions = {
    1: "The Paulson Convention Center offers amenities ---------- to those found at high-end facilities.",
    2: "The computer technician---------- tested the network to determine the source of the connectivity problem.",
    3: "New scientific ------- and improved production techniques were necessary components for developing a successful vaccine.",

for i in range(1, 13):
    print(f"Question {i}: {questions[i]}")
    user_answer = input("Enter your answer: ")
    if user_answer.upper() == answers[i]:
        print("Correct!")
    else:
        print(f"Sorry, the correct answer is {answers[i]}.")
```

This script assumes you have the questions and correct answers stored in a dictionary. It then prompts the user to enter their answer for each question and checks if it matches the correct answer.

Please note that you need to modify the script according to your actual file structure and question format.
